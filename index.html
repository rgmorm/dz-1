    <h1>Monsters University</h1>
    <p>  We all know <b>Mike Wazowski</b> and <b>James P. Sullivan</b>
        to be an inseparable pair, but that was not always
        the case.
    </p>
    <p> From the moment these two mismatched
        monsters met they couldn't stand each other.
        Monsters University unlocks the door to how <b>Mike</b>
        and <b>Sulley</b> overcame
        their differences and became <em>the best of friends</em>.
